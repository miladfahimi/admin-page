# Admin-Page

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.
Latest version of production of The Project is always avilable in githup/pages at (https://milad000.github.io/admin-page-example).

In this project we want to manage an online shop website by having ability to add/remove/update about users,products,categories,deals and etc..., and have our latest data about checkouts, balances and results as charts and lists in first page! create recipts directly, and manage all peyments.

In first step:
Sketch and create an interface prototype of project and create first folders structure as needs in project.
In second step:
Design data models and all data which the app needs.
Next:
Focus more on create html components related to our data which we will work on them.

I decided to use a non-relational data base like MongoDB.
During the project I will use a sample node js server to test the http requests and check if the forms and data flows work or not!

After finish all about Front-end I will start the Back-end part using java and related framework Spring, hibernate.
