## Tennis Court Booking Application Kick-off Guide

### 1. High-Level Architecture (Macro-Services Architecture)

- **Gateway / API Gateway**
  - Entry point for all user requests.
  - Applies rate limiting, initial authentication, and routes to downstream services.

- **Identity & Access Service**
  - Sign-up, login, role management (player, club manager).
  - Supports OAuth/OpenID Connect for integrations with external services.

- **Court Management Service**
  - Manages courts, available slots, and the calendar.
  - Domain model: Court, CourtAvailability, MaintenanceWindow.
  - Domain rules such as "court preparation time after each booking."

- **Booking Service**
  - Handles booking, cancellation, and waitlist management.
  - Domain model: Booking, ReservationPolicy, PaymentStatus.
  - Domain rules such as weekly booking limits per user.

- **Pricing & Payment Service**
  - Calculates costs, discounts, and processes payments.
  - Connects to external payment providers.

- **Notification Service**
  - Sends notifications via email/SMS/push.
  - Event-driven pattern to react to new or canceled bookings.

- **Analytics & Reporting Service**
  - Collects event data (Event Sourcing or CDC).
  - Provides management dashboards.

- **Admin Panel (Angular SPA)**
  - Manages users, courts, and metrics.
  - Communicates through the API Gateway and a dedicated Backend for Frontend (BFF).

- **Player Web App (Angular)**
  - Allows booking, viewing history, and payments.

- **Shared Kernel / Platform Services**
  - Shared library for DTOs, events, and contracts.
  - Supporting services such as logging, monitoring, configuration, and service discovery.

### 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in the Backend

- **Bounded Contexts**: Identity, Court Management, Booking, Billing, Notifications.
- **Context Map**: Relationships (Customer/Supplier, Conformist, Anti-corruption Layer).
- **Aggregates & Entities**: Booking as the aggregate root with value objects like TimeSlot.

### 3. Recommended Tools and Technologies

- **Backend**: NestJS or Spring Boot (both fit microservice and hexagonal architecture with DDD).
- **Message Broker**: Kafka or RabbitMQ for event-driven interactions between services.
- **Database per Service**: e.g., PostgreSQL for Booking and Court; Redis for caching.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform or Pulumi to manage environments.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry + Prometheus/Grafana.

### 4. Suggested Visual Blueprint (Charts)

Use tools like **draw.io (diagrams.net)**, **Miro**, or **Lucidchart** to prepare diagrams:

1. **Context Diagram**: Shows services and high-level interactions (Gateway â†” services, payment gateway, SMS system).
2. **Container Diagram (C4 Model Level 2)**: Breaks down services, databases, message broker, and frontends.
3. **Component Diagram for each Bounded Context**: Internal components of the Booking Service (Application Layer, Domain Layer, Infrastructure Layer).
4. **Sequence Diagram for the Booking Scenario**: From user sign-in to notification delivery.

### 5. Resources and Templates

- **Awesome Microservices Templates**
  - [Microservices.io](https://microservices.io/) for architecture patterns.
  - [Awesome Microservices (GitHub)](https://github.com/mfornos/awesome-microservices) for project lists and frameworks.

- **DDD Resources**
  - [Awesome Domain-Driven Design](https://github.com/heynickc/awesome-ddd).
  - Sample projects for DDD with NestJS: search for "nestjs ddd microservices boilerplate."

- **Angular + Nx Monorepo**
  - [Nx Workspace](https://nx.dev/) for creating a monorepo with Angular and NestJS.
  - Template [nrwl/nx-examples](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-examples).

- **Hexagonal Architecture Samples**
  - [albertllousas/hexagonal-architecture-example](https://github.com/albertllousas/hexagonal-architecture-example).
  - For Java/Spring: [melardev/hexagonal-architecture-springboot](https://github.com/melardev/hexagonal-architecture-springboot).

### 6. Suggested Onboarding Workflow

1. **Define the Vision and Use Cases**: Key scenarios for booking, court management, and payments.
2. **Domain Modeling with Event Storming**: Identify aggregates and domain events.
3. **Design the Context Map**: Establish service boundaries.
4. **Create an Nx Monorepo** (Angular + NestJS) or choose a multi-repo approach.
5. **Implement Gateway and Identity** as the foundation.
6. **Build Booking and Court Services** with domain-level tests.
7. **Develop the Angular Frontend** with a BFF or GraphQL in mind.
8. **Consider DevOps and Observability** from day one (pipelines, monitoring).

### 7. Visual Design Tools

- **diagrams.net** (free and simple)
- **Miro** (collaborative)
- **Figma** (UI/UX and wireframes)
- **Structurizr** (C4 model modeling)

You can start with a base diagram in one of these tools and gradually add more details.
